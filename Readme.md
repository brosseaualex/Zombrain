## Description

This project was an exam/test I had to go through during my Unity game developement course at school.

## Important Notice

For this test, I was provided with a small/medium sized project with some bugs and missing features and I had to find those bugs and add the missing feature(s).

This project was also used to "test" my analytical skill and there was a series of questions asked referring to certain portion of the code and I had to research/analyse the code and find the answers.

The "complete" test questions can be found in the "Assets/Test.cs" file.
